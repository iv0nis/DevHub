# Blueprint Completeness Evaluation Weights
# Each check contributes to final score based on these weights
# Total should sum to 1.0

structural_sections: 0.15   # Required sections present in blueprint
objectives_coverage: 0.15   # Charter objectives mapped to blueprint components  
functional_coverage: 0.25   # Functional requirements covered by flows/APIs
nfr_coverage: 0.20         # Non-functional requirements addressed
constraints_mapped: 0.15    # Charter constraints reflected in ADRs
glossary_consistency: 0.10  # Terminology consistency between docs

# Note: Functional coverage has highest weight as it's most critical
# for development team to have clear implementation guidance
